# Social-Network-Theme-With-Sass
:heavy_check_mark: In This Project I Rebuild the Social Network theme (DevConnector build by [Brad Travesy](https://github.com/bradtraversy) Following course at YouTube [Travery Media](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-Rfqba3xeEvDzIcUCxwMlGiewfV). I Learned  a Lot about Sass through this Project. Highly Recommended for those who want to learn Sass.
